- Multiples of 3 have been replaced with `Fizz`
- Multiples of 5 have been replaced with `Buzz`
- Multiples of both have been replaced with `FizzBuzz`

fizzBuzzToN(5) // => [1,2,'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz']

fizzBuzzToN(15) // => [1,2,'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz']
```
